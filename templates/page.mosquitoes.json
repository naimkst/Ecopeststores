Such biting is considered only to be a nuisance since there appears to be negligible risk of human disease transmission by mosquitoes in this area.",

Hot or windy weather will tend to confine resting or flight activities of mosquitoes to more humid areas, particularly those that are shaded by vegetation.  Therefore, to avoid being bitten, stay away from heavily treed areas, bushes and long grass.  Keep lawns trim and garden areas weed-free to make home surrounding less attractive to mosquitoes.  Help keep them outdoors by ensuring home window and door screens are in place and effective. Female mosquitos are the only ones that bite so wear long sleeve shirts and pants especially during dawn and dusk with plenty of mosquito repellent.<\/p>",
